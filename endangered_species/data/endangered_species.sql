('mammal', 'Florida Bonneted Bat', 'Eumops floridanus', '<p>The Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus) is a species of bat in the genus Eumops, the bonneted bats or mastiff bats. Until recently, it was treated as a subtaxon of Wagner''s bonneted bat (Eumops glaucinus). It is endemic to southern Florida in the United States. Its range includes Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Coral Gables, Florida. This species has one of the smallest geographical distributions of any New World bat. It has been called "one of the most critically endangered mammal species in North America".</p> <h2>Biology</h2> <p>The female bears a single pup. The breeding season extends throughout the summer, and a second pup may be born in winter. It roosts singly or colonially and may form harems. Colonies can be found in tree cavities, including in pine trunks and the fronds of royal palm (Roystonea regia), under roof tiles, especially on Spanish tile roofs, and in rock outcroppings. Its tendency to roost in rock crevices may explain why so many well-preserved fossil specimens have been found. It flies at night, staying high up, usually above 30 feet in the air. It can take off from a flat surface, unlike many other bats, which launch after dropping from their roosts.</p> <h2>Conservation</h2><p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the bat as a Critically Endangered species. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission classifies it as an endangered species. Its NatureServe conservation status is critically imperiled. Its populations have decreased in part because of pesticides and the loss of appropriate roosting sites. It is believed that in 1992, Hurricane Andrew destroyed many stands of old cavity-ridden trees used as habitat by the bat. It is also a Federally listed species of the United States, as of October 2013.</p>', 'images/mammals/large/florida_bat.jpg', 'images/mammals/thumb/florida_bat.jpg', 0, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumops_floridanus'),
('mammal', 'Northern Sea Otter', 'Enhydra lutris kenyoni', '<p>The sea otter (Enhydra lutris) is a marine mammal native to the coasts of the northern and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Adult sea otters typically weigh between 14 and 45 kg (31 and 99 lb), making them the heaviest members of the weasel family, but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter''s primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter lives mostly in the ocean. </p> <p>The sea otter inhabits offshore environments, where it dives to the sea floor to forage. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as sea urchins, various molluscs and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a keystone species, controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.</p> <h2>Physical characteristics</h2><p>The sea otter is one of the smallest marine mammal species, but it is the heaviest mustelid. Male sea otters usually weigh 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb) and are 1.2 to 1.5 m (3 ft 11 in to 4 ft 11 in) in length, though specimens to 54 kg (119 lb) have been recorded. Females are smaller, weighing 14 to 33 kg (31 to 73 lb) and measuring 1.0 to 1.4 m (3 ft 3 in to 4 ft 7 in) in length. For its size, the male otter''s baculum is very large, massive and bent upwards, measuring 150 mm (5.9 in) in length and 15 mm (0.59 in) at the base.</p>', 'images/mammals/large/sea_otter.jpg', 'images/mammals/thumb/sea_otter.jpg', 1, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_otter'),
('mammal', 'San Joaquin Kit Fox', 'Vulpes macrotis mutica', '<p>The kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) is a fox species of North America. Its range is primarily in the Southwestern United States and northern and central Mexico. Some mammalogists classify it as conspecific with the swift fox, V. velox, but molecular systematics imply that the two species are distinct.</p> <h2>Subspecies</h2> <p>The endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) was formerly very common in the San Joaquin Valley and through much of Central California. Its 1990 population was estimated to be 7,000. This subspecies is still endangered, after nearly 50 years of being on the Endangered Species List. Officially this subspecies was listed March 3, 1967. On September 26, 2007, Wildlands Inc. announced the designation of the 684-acre (2.77 km2) Deadman Creek Conservation Bank, which is intended specifically to protect habitat of the San Joaquin kit fox. However, the population continues to decline mostly due to heavy habitat loss. Other factors include competition from red fox, and the extermination of the gray wolf from California has left the coyote as the dominant meso-predator in kit fox territory bringing an unbalance in ecosystem relationships. One park where San Joaquin kit foxes can be found, Carrizo Plains National Monument allows coyote hunting which can contribute to kit fox loss because of a lack of understanding of the differences between these two species of Canidae.</p><h2>Appearance</h2> <p>The kit fox is the smallest species of the family Canidae found in North America. It has large ears, between 71 and 95 mm (2.8 and 3.75 in), that help the fox lower its body temperature and give it exceptional hearing (much like those of the fennec fox). This species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the male being slightly larger. The average species weight is between 1.6 and 2.7 kg (3.5 and 6.0 lbs). The body length is 455 to 535 mm (18 to 21 in). The tail adds another 250â€“340 mm (9.85â€“13.4 in) to its length.\r\nIt usually has a gray coat, with rusty tones, and a black tip to its tail. Unlike the gray fox, it has no stripe along the length of its tail. Its color ranges from yellowish to gray, and the back is usually darker than the majority of its coat; its belly and inner ears are usually lighter. It has distinct dark patches around the nose.</p>', 'images/mammals/large/vulpes_macrotis.jpg', 'images/mammals/thumb/vulpes_macrotis.jpg', 2, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_fox'),
('mammal', 'Gray wolf', 'Canis lupus', '<p>The gray wolf or grey wolf (Canis lupus) also known as the timber wolf, or western wolf, is a canid native to the wilderness and remote areas of North America and Eurasia. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging 43 to 45 kg (95 to 99 lb), and females 36 to 38.5 kg (79 to 85 lb). Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur. As of 2005,37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by MSW3.</p> <p>The gray wolf is the second most specialised member of the genus Canis, after the Ethiopian wolf, as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature, and its highly advanced expressive behavior. It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species, such as the eastern wolf, coyote and golden jackal to produce fertile hybrids. Its closest relative is the domestic dog, with which it shared a common European ancestor which likely diverged 40,000 years ago. It is the only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds, and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene, colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean. It is a social animal, travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair''s adult offspring. The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it. It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.</p><h2>Physical description</h2><p>Compared to its closest wild cousins (the coyote and golden jackal), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply descending ribcage, a sloping back and a heavily muscled neck. The wolf''s legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males. The gray wolf''s head is large and heavy, with a wide forehead, strong jaws and a long, blunt muzzle. The ears are relatively small and triangular. The teeth are heavy and large, being better suited to crushing bone than those of other extant canids, though not as specialised as those found in hyenas. Its molars have a flat chewing surface, but not to the same extent as the coyote, whose diet contains more vegetable matter. The gray wolf''s jaws can exert a crushing pressure of perhaps 10,340 kPa (1,500 psi) compared to 5,200 kPa (750 psi) for a German shepherd. This force is sufficient to break open most bones. The gray wolf usually carries its head at the same level as the back, raising it only when alert. It usually travels at a loping pace, placing its paws one directly in front of the other. This gait can be maintained for hours at a rate of 8â€“9 km/h, and allows the wolf to cover great distances. On bare paths, a wolf can quickly achieve speeds of 50 to 60 km/h. The gray wolf has a running gait of 55 to 70 km/h, can leap 5 metres horizontally in a single bound, and can maintain rapid pursuit for at least 20 minutes.</p>', 'images/mammals/large/grey_wolf.jpg', 'images/mammals/thumb/grey_wolf.jpg', 3, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf'),
('mammal', 'Northern flying squirrel', 'Glaucomys sabrinus', '<p>The northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) is one of two species of the genus Glaucomys, the only flying squirrels found in North America (the other is the somewhat smaller southern flying squirrel, G. volans). Unlike most members of their family, flying squirrels are strictly nocturnal.</p><h2>Habitat and range</h2><p>The northern flying squirrel is found in coniferous and mixed coniferous forests across the top of North America, from Alaska to Nova Scotia, south to the mountains of North Carolina and west to California. Populations from the Pacific Coast of the United States are genetically distinct from those of G. sabrinus found elsewhere in North America, although they are considered to belong to the same species.\nTwo subspecies are found in the southern Appalachians, the Carolina northern flying squirrel, G. s. coloratus, and the Virginia northern flying squirrel G. s. fuscus, both of which are endangered, although the Virginia subspecies has recovered enough that it was delisted in August 2008. In California, the range extends to Yosemite Valley.</p><h2>Behaviour</h2><p>Northern flying squirrels generally nest in holes in trees, preferring large-diameter trunks and dead trees, and will also build outside leaf nests called dreys and will also nest underground. Tree cavities created by woodpeckers as suitable nest sites tend to be more abundant in old-growth forests, and so do the squirrels, though harvested forests can be managed in ways that are likely to increase squirrel numbers. Except when rearing young, the squirrels shift from nest to nest frequently. They often share nests during winter months, forming aggregations. Usually, aggregate nests contain 4 to 10 individuals. The sharing of nests in winter by northern flying squirrels is important in maintaining body temperature (biothermal regulation), as northern flying squirrels do not hibernate, nor do they enter torpor states. In the United States Sierra Nevada range, they use the lichen Bryoria fremontii as a material for building nests, in addition to as a winter food source.</p>', 'images/mammals/large/flying_squirrel.jpg', 'images/mammals/thumb/flying_squirrel.jpg', 6, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_flying_squirrel'),
('mammal', 'Utah prairie dog', 'Cynomys parvidens', '<p>The Utah prairie dog (Cynomys parvidens) is the smallest species of prairie dog, a member of the squirrel family of rodents native to the south central steppes of the US state of Utah.</p><h2>Body Size</h2><p>The total body length of typical adult ranges from 30.5 cm to 36.0 cm with 3 cm to 6 cm of tail. Adult prairie dogs weigh about 0.77 kg to 1.41 kg in males, and 0.64 kg to 1.13 kg in females. Utah prairie dogs show sexual dimorphism that males are 27% bigger than female, although the ratio varies by season. In 1952, Durant noted that Utah prairie dogs have larger in every aspect of skull than that of Gunnison''s prairie dog.</p><h2>Conservation Status</h2><p>The species appears in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with a status of Endangered, last assessed in 2008. The Utah prairie dog is listed as a threatened species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1972, studies estimated a population of 3,300 Utah prairie dogs in 37 colonies. Studies by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources in spring 2004 reported 4,022 Utah prairie dogs, a number believed to reflect half of the total current population. The Utah prairie dog can do significant damage to farms by digging holes and eating crops, drawing the ire of Utah farmers, who have used poison liberally to destroy the animal. This is a major reason for the population decline, though there are other factors, such as "land development, deteriorating rangeland health, the encroachment of woody vegetation, sylvatic plague, and drought." Conservation efforts include encouraging landowners to improve the health of their rangelands, and compensating farmers who set aside areas the prairie dogs may use.</p>', 'images/mammals/large/utah.jpg', 'images/mammals/thumb/utah.jpg', 5, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_prairie_dog'),
('mammal', 'Blue whale', 'Balaenoptera musculus', '<p>The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whales (Mysticeti). At 30 metres (98 ft) in length and 180 tonnes (200 short tons) or more in weight, it is the largest extant animal and is the heaviest known to have existed.</p><p>Blue whales were abundant in nearly all the oceans on Earth until the beginning of the twentieth century. For over a century, they were hunted almost to extinction by whalers until protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide, in at least five groups. More recent research into the Pygmy subspecies suggests this may be an overestimate. Before whaling, the largest population was in the Antarctic, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000). There remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern North Pacific, Antarctic, and Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the North Atlantic, and at least two in the Southern Hemisphere. As of 2014, the Californian blue whale population has rebounded to nearly its pre-hunting population.</p><h2>Description and behaviour</h2><p>The blue whale has a long tapering body that appears stretched in comparison with the stockier build of other whales. The head is flat, U-shaped and has a prominent ridge running from the blowhole to the top of the upper lip. The front part of the mouth is thick with baleen plates; around 300 plates (each around one metre (3.2 ft) long) hang from the upper jaw, running 0.5 m (1.6 ft) back into the mouth. Between 70 and 118 grooves (called ventral pleats) run along the throat parallel to the body length. These pleats assist with evacuating water from the mouth after lunge feeding (see feeding below).</p>', 'images/mammals/large/blue_whale.jpg', 'images/mammals/thumb/blue_whale.jpg', 4, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale'),
('mammal', 'American black bear ', 'Ursus americanus', '<p>The American black bear (Ursus americanus) is a medium-sized bear native to North America. It is the continents smallest and most widely distributed bear species. Black bears are omnivores with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, but do leave forests in search of food. Sometimes they become attracted to human communities because of the immediate availability of food. The American black bear is the worlds most common bear species.</p><h2>Distribution and population</h2><p>Historically, black bears occupied the majority of North Americas forested regions. Today, they are primarily limited to sparsely settled, forested areas. Black bears currently inhabit much of their original Canadian range, though they seldom occur in the southern farmlands of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba; they have been extinct in Prince Edward Island since 1937. The total Canadian black bear population is between 396,000 and 476,000, based on surveys taken in the mid-1990s in seven Canadian provinces, though this estimate excludes black bear populations in New Brunswick, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan. All provinces indicated stable populations of black bears over the last decade.</p><h2>Habitat</h2><p>Throughout their range, habitats preferred by American black bears have a few shared characteristics. They are often found in areas with relatively inaccessible terrain, thick understory vegetation and large quantities of edible material (especially masts). The adaptation to woodlands and thick vegetation in this species may have originally been due to the black bear having evolved alongside larger, more aggressive bear species, such as the extinct short-faced bear and the still living grizzly bear, that monopolized more open habitats  and the historic presence of larger predators such as smilodon and the American lion that could have preyed on black bears. Although found in the largest numbers in wild, undisturbed areas and rural regions, black bears can adapt to surviving in some numbers in peri-urban regions as long as they contain easily accessible foods and some vegetative coverage. In most of the contiguous United States, black bears today are usually found in heavily vegetated mountainous areas, from 400 to 3,000 m (1,300 to 9,800 ft). For bears living in the American Southwest and Mexico, habitat usually consists of stands of chaparral and pinyon juniper woods. In this region, bears occasionally move to more open areas to feed on prickly pear cactus.</p>', 'images/mammals/large/black_bear.jpg', 'images/mammals/thumb/black_bear.jpg', 7, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_black_bear'),
('birds', 'Whooping crane', 'Grus americana', '<p>The whooping crane (Grus americana), the tallest North American bird, is an endangered crane species named for its whooping sound. In 2003, there were about 153 pairs of whooping cranes. Along with the sandhill crane, it is one of only two crane species found in North America. The whooping crane''s lifespan is estimated to be 22 to 24 years in the wild. After being pushed to the brink of extinction by unregulated hunting and loss of habitat to just 21 wild and two captive whooping cranes by 1941, conservation efforts have led to a limited recovery. As of 2011, there are an estimated 437 birds in the wild and more than 165 in captivity.</p><h2>Habitat</h2><p>The muskeg of the taiga in Wood Buffalo National Park, Alberta, Canada, and the surrounding area was the last remnant of the former nesting habitat of the Whooping Crane Summer Range. However, with the recent Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership Reintroduction Project, whooping cranes nested naturally for the first time in 100 years in the Necedah National Wildlife Refuge in central Wisconsin, United States. They nest on the ground, usually on a raised area in a marsh. The female lays 1 or 2 eggs, usually in late-April to mid-May. The blotchy, olive-coloured eggs average 2 inches in breadth and 4 inches in length (60 by 100 mm), and weigh about 6.7 ounces (190 g). The incubation period is 29 to 31 days. Both parents brood the young, although the female is more likely to directly tend to the young. Usually no more than one young bird survives in a season. The parents often feed the young for 6â€“8 months after birth and the terminus of the offspring-parent relationship occurs after about 1 year.</p>', 'images/birds/large/whooping_crane.jpg', 'images/birds/thumb/whooping_crane.jpg', 8, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_crane'),
('birds', 'Yellow-shouldered blackbird', 'Agelaius xanthomus', '<p>The yellow-shouldered blackbird (Agelaius xanthomus), also known as la Mariquita de Puerto Rico or capitÃ¡n, is a diurnal blackbird endemic to the archipelago of Puerto Rico and one of the species belonging to the genus Agelaius of the family Icteridae. It has black plumage with a prominent yellow shoulder on its wing. Adult males and females are of similar appearance. The species is predominantly insectivorous.</p><h2>Distribution and habitat</h2><p>The species was once commonly found in the coastal forests of the archipelago of Puerto Rico but during the early 20th century these forests were destroyed to allow for the development of sugarcane plantations. After the decline of the sugar industry after the 1930s the coastal areas were developed for housing. As a result, the species is now limited to three areas: the islands of Mona and Monito, where a subspecies developed (A. g. xmonensis); the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station area in eastern Puerto Rico; and the southern Puerto Rican dry forests and mangroves. Although all three locations are considered coastal subtropical dry forests, the species has been observed as far inland as the mountain town of Lares and in subtropical wet forests during the non-breeding season. The species has also been observed at the Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge. The destruction of habitat and brood parasitism by the shiny cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) led to a drastic population decline from the mid 1970s to early 1980s. In 1976, the population of the nominate form was estimated at 2000 individuals but in 1982 the population estimate dropped to 300 individuals. Conservation efforts have increased the population to 1250 pairs.</p>', 'images/birds/large/blackbird.jpg', 'images/birds/thumb/blackbird.jpg', 9, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-shouldered_blackbird'),

This condor became extinct in the wild in 1987 (all remaining wild individuals were captured), but the species has been reintroduced to northern Arizona and southern Utah (including the Grand Canyon area and Zion National Park), the coastal mountains of central and southern California, and northern Baja California. Although other fossil members are known, it is the only surviving member of the genus Gymnogyps. The species is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.</p><p>The plumage is black with patches of white on the underside of the wings; the head is largely bald, with skin color ranging from gray on young birds to yellow and bright orange on breeding adults. Its huge 3.0 m (9.8 ft) wingspan is the widest of any North American bird, and its weight of up to 12 kg (26 lb) nearly equals that of the trumpeter swan, the heaviest among native North American bird species. The condor is a scavenger and eats large amounts of carrion. It is one of the world''s longest-living birds, with a lifespan of up to 60 years.</p><h2>Habitat</h2><p>The condors live in rocky shrubland, coniferous forests, and oak savannas. They are often found near cliffs or large trees, which they use as nesting sites. Individual birds have a huge range and have been known to travel up to 250 km (160 mi) in search of carrion.\r\nThere are two sanctuaries dedicated to this bird, the Sisquoc Condor Sanctuary in the San Rafael Wilderness and the Sespe Condor Sanctuary in the Los Padres National Forest.

('birds', 'Hawaiian gallinule', 'Gallinula galeata sandvicensis', '<p>The Hawaiian gallinule (Gallinula galeata sandvicensis) is an endangered chicken sized water bird in the rail family. It is also variously known as the Hawaiian common gallinule, Hawaiian Moorhen, Hawaiian common moorhen, mudhen, locally in Hawaiian as the alae ula (â€œburnt foreheadâ€ - for its prominent red frontal shield), and sometimes misleadingly as the Hawaiian red coot. It is a subspecies of the common gallinule that is endemic to the tropical Hawaiian Islands of the north-central Pacific Ocean.</p><h2>Behaviour</h2><p>The gallinules are secretive birds, spending much time in dense wetland vegetation. While feeding in the open they will quickly seek cover when disturbed. Despite the lack of webbing or lobes on their toes, the birds are good swimmers. They moult over a period of about 25 days each year, normally between June and September, when they are unable to fly and so more vulnerable to predation.</p>', 'images/birds/large/gallinule.jpg', 'images/birds/thumb/gallinule.jpg', 11, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_gallinule'),
('birds', 'Willow flycatcher', 'Empidonax traillii extimus', '<p>The willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii) is a small insect-eating, neotropical migrant bird of the tyrant flycatcher family. There are four subspecies of the willow flycatcher currently recognized, all of which breed in North America (including three subspecies that breed in California). Empidonax flycatchers are almost impossible to tell apart in the field so biologists use their songs to distinguish between them. The binomial commemorates the Scottish zoologist Thomas Stewart Traill.</p><h2>Description and ecology</h2><p>Adults have brown-olive upperparts, darker on the wings and tail, with whitish underparts; they have an indistinct white eye ring, white wing bars and a small bill. The breast is washed with olive-gray. The upper part of the bill is gray; the lower part is orangish. At one time, this bird and the alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum) were considered to be a single species, Traills flycatcher. The willow and alder flycatchers were considered the same species until the 1970s. Their song is the only reliable method to tell them apart in the field .</p><p>Their breeding habitat is deciduous thickets, especially willows and often near water, across the United States and southern Canada. They make a cup nest in a vertical fork in a shrub or tree.\r These neotropical birds migrate to Mexico and Central America, and in small numbers as far south as Ecuador in South America, often selecting winter habitat near water.

Its position in parrot phylogeny is the subject of ongoing discussion; it is sometimes referred to as thick-billed macaw or thick-billed conure. In Mexico, it is locally called guacamaya ("macaw") or cotorra serrana ("mountain parrot"). Classified internationally as Endangered through IUCN, the thick-billed parrot''s decline has been central to multiple controversies over wildlife management.</p><h2>Distribution and habitat</h2><p>The thick-billed parrot lives in temperate conifer, pine, mature pine-oak and fir forests at elevation of 1200-3600 meters. It is largely restricted to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Chihuahua and Durango, Mexico.\r Its former range included the United States including Arizona and New Mexico. Early accounts also place them in far west Texas (Audubon, El Paso, 1827), and possibly as far north as Utah. Accounts in both Arizona and New Mexico indicate birds visiting regularly, as well as over-wintering in Arizona. However, these accounts co-occurred with heavy shooting, logging, and development that extirpated the thick-billed parrot from its US range. The disruption of Native American ways of life greatly decreased the northern modern range of some bird species (i.e., the boreal owl) that utilized Native American irrigation and farm land, and it is possible that the thick-billed parrot also suffered from this effect of European colonization.\r The last reliable reports of the birds in the southwestern United States were in 1935 and 1938 in the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona.</p>', 'images/birds/large/arizona.jpg', 'images/birds/thumb/arizona.jpg', 14, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thick-billed_parrot'),

It is one of two living species in the genus Alligator within the family Alligatoridae; it is larger than the other extant alligator species, the Chinese alligator. Adult male American alligators measure up to 3.4 to 4.6 m (11 to 15 ft) in length, and can weigh up to 453 kg (999 lb). Females are smaller, measuring around 3 m (9.8 ft). The American alligator inhabits freshwater wetlands, such as marshes and cypress swamps from Texas to North Carolina. It is distinguished from the sympatric American crocodile by its broader snout, with overlapping jaws and darker coloration, and is less tolerant of saltwater but more tolerant of cooler climates than the American crocodile, which is found only in tropical climates.</p><h2>Conservation status</h2><p>Historically, hunting and habitat loss have severely impacted alligator populations throughout their range, and whether the species would survive was in doubt. In 1967, the alligator was listed as an endangered species (under a law that was the precursor Endangered Species Act of 1973), since it was believed to be in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and state wildlife agencies in the South contributed to the American alligator''s recovery. Protection under the Endangered Species Act allowed the species to recuperate in many areas where it had been depleted. States began monitoring their alligator populations to ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed off as alligators during trafficking.</p>', 'images/reptiles/large/alligator.jpg', 'images/reptiles/thumb/alligator.jpg', 16, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_alligator'),

Although generally brown and speckled, their color can range from black to purplish gray, sometimes with green patches. The toads typically live 2 to 3 years and create burrows for protection from the cold in the winter and the hot, dry conditions of the summer. They are nocturnal and feed on insects and small invertebrates.\r During February and March, the male emits a high clear trill by distending a vocal sac on its throat, in hopes of attracting a mate. A female will choose a male based on certain characteristics of his call. Small isolated pools and ponds are the toad''s main breeding ground. A female toad will lay several thousand eggs in long single-egg strands that are fertilized externally by the male as they are laid. The eggs hatch within seven days and tadpoles take between 15 to 100 days to turn into little toads.

Yosemite toads show a narrow elevational distribution from 6,200 feet to 11,300 feet. They are the most sexually dichromatic anuran in North America, with males and females displaying strikingly divergent patterns and coloration at maturity. Adult toads are long-lived with upper age limits estimated from 15 to 20 years, likely an adaptation to their seasonal, high-elevation environment. Yosemite toads have declined substantially in distribution and abundance across their restricted range, and are IUCN endangered, soon-to-be ESA threatened, and are a California species of special concern.</p><h2>Ecology</h2><p>The Yosemite toad utilizes montane meadows, sub-alpine meadows, riparian areas and the surrounding forest matrix as critical habitat during the various stages of its life history. They are explosive breeders, migrating to breeding pools and flooded areas in late spring while snowbanks still veil the frozen meadows. Males intermittently give an advertisement call from pool margins, under logs, or inside willows to attract females. Their specific name, canorus (meaning "melodious"), reflects the tuneful and pleasant sound produced by this species. When females arrive, they are immediately grasped in amplexus by one or multiple males as the males fight for a limited number of mating opportunities. Breeding sex ratios can be very skewed toward males (10:1) since females may breed infrequently (every 2 to 4 years). While in amplexus, females will hop around for several days and lay one or more clutches of 1,000 to 10,000 eggs, which are strung together and resemble two black pearl necklaces in a helical structure.

The dams block passage to and from the ocean, leaving landlocked populations. The higher water levels have, as a result, destroyed areas that once had rapid currents, eliminating spawning grounds. Now, the only healthy population of white sturgeon on the Columbia River and its tributaries is the lower Columbia River population. These fish are still able to move freely between marine, estuarine, and freshwater environments. All other populations have become landlocked because of the dams. These populations have suffered from the inaccessibility of many food sources, inability to migrate, and destruction of their habitat. As a result, none of the populations above Bonneville Dam is considered to be abundant. White sturgeon in the Kootenai River are at such a low level, they were listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 1994. Some white sturgeon populations, however, do support fisheries. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has worked together with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Columbia River Treaty Tribes to impose size restrictions as well as season and quota restrictions on all sturgeon caught in the Columbia River.
